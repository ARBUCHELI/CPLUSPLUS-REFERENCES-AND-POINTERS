“You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.” - Ray Bradbury 

Congratulations on your new job at the Department of Re-education! You have been tasked with building an algorithm that can bleep out any words deemed unsavory by the powers that be.

Write a bleep.cpp program that “bleeps” any word that’s passed in. You’ll test this out with "broccoli", which has been recently banned by the Department.

Turn some text like "I'm rolling up my broccoli" into "I'm rolling up my ********".

Make sure to use pass-by-reference in your functions so you can modify the incoming text!

* Getting started:
------------------
1.
First include <iostream> and <string> because you are definitely going to need them, as well as a main() function.


Hint
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main() {
 
 
}

2.
Inside main(), create two std::string variables:

	. word with a value of "broccoli".

	. text with a longer text with multiple "broccoli"s in it.

Hint
For example:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
int main() {
 
  std::string word = "broccoli";
 
  std::string sentence = "I sometimes eat broccoli. There are three interesting things about broccoli. Number One. Nobody knows how to spell it. Number Two. No matter how long you boil it, it's always cold by the time it reaches your plate. Number Three. It's green. #broccoli";
 
}

* Create a bleep() function:
----------------------------
3.
Write a bleep() function that takes in the word and text and replace each word with asterisks *.

And make sure to use pass-by-reference so you can modify the text.

This is an algorithms problem that will require some planning beforehand so take some time and brainstorm how to do this on paper before start writing the code! A nested loop might be required.
